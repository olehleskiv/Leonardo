		Mara walls of the fortress, the Citadel and the tower Kanila, which were build opposite the entrance to Boka Kotor Bay, have protected the city of Herceg-Novi for six centuries. The city was built from the XIV to XVII century - the walls were covered with some exotic plants that local sailors brought from distant wanderings. Herceg-Novi - the city of sun and flowers. The diverse flora of the region rightly makes this town a botanical garden of whole Montenegro.

	<h3>Sights of Herceg - Novi</h3>

	<p>
		Sights of the city are a real reflection of its history. Austrians erected a watch tower here, and the Venetians built a defensive bastion which was intended to protect the village on the side of the sea. This sea fortress called <i>Forte Mare</i> and watch tower have been kept in Herceg Novi until today. The Spanish built a fortress <i>Shpanola</i>, and under the rule of the Turks in the sixteenth century, the city has another citadel - <i>Kanli Kula - or "Bloody Tower"</i>. Equally ominous name of the structure is due to the fact that in the old days it was a prison, where unfortunate prisoners served their sentences for many years. Kanli Kula, has a completely different purpose today. Theatrical performances and movies are shown at the open area of the fortress.
